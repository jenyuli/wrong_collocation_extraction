# wrong_collocation_extraction
In this research we have investigated the extraction of collocational errors made by English learners from a learner corpus.
A system of wrong collocation extraction was proposed and implemented with an open source toolkit NLTK. 
The collocation extraction module was evaluated by the corpus PARSEME where collocations were manually annotated. 
Secondly, we have constructed a correct collocation list from BNC. 
Thirdly, a wrong collocation list was generated by extracting candidates from NUCLE and discarding correct collocations on the list. 
The overall performance was also evaluated. The system was functionable, although its performance was not very satisfactory.
